Spray the inside of the pans with canola oil. Place parchment circles in the pan bottoms and spray over top with canola oil. Set aside.\nPrepare & Bake Cakes: in a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, melted butter, and milk. Add cake mix. Whisk together until batter is smooth; fold in orange zest. Divide batter evenly among the 3 cake pans. Place on center oven rack and bake; at 40 minutes, test cake centers with a toothpick; when toothpicks come out clean, remove cakes and let cool (in pans) for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, run a knife around the inside of each cake pan, flip pans upside down and ease cakes out onto a cooling rack to cool completely, about 40-50 minutes.\nPrepare Frosting: while cakes are cooling, make buttercream frosting. Add butter to a stand mixer (a hand mixer will work too) fitted with a paddle; beat at medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar, cream, and vanilla; mix at low speed until just combined. Increase the speed to high and mix until smooth and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. If it becomes too thick, add a little more cream. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.\nMeasure about 1 cup of plain buttercream frosting, set aside. Fold in diced strawberries into remaining frosting.\nAssemble Cake: place dollop of frosting in center of cake stand or platter to anchor. Place first cake, top side down, over the frosting and center on the plate. Carefully apply strawberry buttercream along the edges, leaving bare a medium-sized circle in the center of the cake. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of strawberry preserves into the frosting-less center; top preserves with fresh sliced strawberries. Place the next layer on top of the first and repeat strawberry buttercream, preserves and sliced strawberries steps.\nPlace the last cake layer on top and frost with strawberry buttercream; as lightly as you'd like, frost sides of the entire cake with plain buttercream.

Boil the water. Reduce the heat to allow the water to simmer. Rest a large bowl over the top of the pan, making sure that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Add caramels and water to the top bowl. Stir the caramels as they melt, until they become smooth.",

Spray the inside of the pans with canola oil. Place parchment circles on the bottom of each pan and spray over top with butter flavored oil. Set aside.\nPrepare & Bake Cakes: in three separate bowls, prepare each cake mix. For vanilla cake, mix together 2 eggs, 1 stick of melted butter, and 1 cup milk; add dry mix and whisk until batter is smooth; pour into cake pan. For brownies, whisk together 2 eggs with 1 stick of melted butter; add dry mix and stir until moistened; pour into cake pan. For blondies, whisk together 1 egg with 1 stick of melted butter; add dry mix and stir until moistened; pour into cake pan. Bake all three cakes per directions on package (note: the vanilla cake takes about 10 minutes longer, so make this one first). Remove cakes and let cool (in pans) for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, run a knife around the inside of each cake pan, flip pans upside down and ease cakes out onto a cooling rack to cool completely, about 40-50 minutes.\nPrepare Frosting: while cakes are cooling, make buttercream frosting. Add butter to stand mixer (a hand mixer will work too) fitted with a paddle; beat at medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sugar, cream, and vanilla; mix at low speed until just incorporated. Increase the speed to high and mix until smooth and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. If it becomes too thick, add a little more cream. If it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.\nAssemble Cake: place a dollop of buttercream on cake stand or platter to anchor, place brownie layer on top. Pipe or spread buttercream frosting along the edges of the cake; fill in center with ¼ jar of caramel sauce. Top with blondie cake and repeat buttercream and caramel step. Top with vanilla cake layer; as lightly as you like frost sides of the entire cake with remaining buttercream.\nDecorate Cake: warm the jar of fudge sauce for 10 seconds in the microwave and pour ½ over the top of the cake and allow to flow down the sides in long drips.

Set aside.Once dough is softened, working in two batches, unroll and smooth together any cracks with your hands over the top of the plastic film of the dough. Remove plastic film and place dough onto a floured surface. Cut out 7 circles from one roll and 7 circles from the other (it could be more or less depending on the size of your cookie cutter, just make sure you end up with an even number). Place all dough circles onto two baking trays lined with parchment paper and place back in refrigerator to chill.In a medium bowl, combine strained blueberries, lemon zest, lemon curd and flour. Stir and set aside. Prepare egg wash by whisking egg with water in a small bowl. Set aside.Remove dough from refrigerator and place a spoonful of the lemon-blueberry mix onto 7 of the dough circles, making sure not to overfill or touch the edges of the dough. Brush egg wash around the perimeter of each filled dough circle. Place the remaining 7 dough circles on top of the mounds, then crimp the edges of the dough with a fork to seal each pie. Place prepared pies back in refrigerator to chill another 10 minutes before baking.Preheat oven to 375°F. Remove pies from refrigerator and brush tops generously with egg wash. With a sharp knife, cut a slit or a small design on the top of each pie to help steam release while baking. Sprinkle turbinado sugar over the top of each pie, if using. Bake pies on center rack of oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the blueberry juices start bubbling and the pastry is golden brown. For even baking, rotate sheet halfway though. Transfer to a cooling rack and serve warm.",
