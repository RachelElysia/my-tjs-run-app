## About My Project

TJ's Run revolutionizes the way users shop at Trader Joe's. Users can save their favorite Trader Joe recipes and choose which of those recipes they want to shop for. With the click of a button, users can simply receive a text of their grocery list directly to their phone. Never forget to write your grocery list and never miss an ingredient again!

### Inspiration

Driven by the user experience, I wanted to revolutionize using a cookbook. I identified painpoints of the User Journey of cooking from a cookbook. I leveraged a raw 2-JSON-file API a Trader Joe's Recipe API to create the best UX possible.

### MVP Feature

Users choose from their favorite recipes to text a simple grocery list directly to their phone. Users can add and remove their favorite Trader Joe's recipes. With only a few clicks, users quickly build and text new grocery lists to their phone.
